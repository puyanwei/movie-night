# Movie Night

This was a tech test set by Jigsaw. I am going to try and complete these user stories and get better with using React.

### User Stories

```

### Installation and Setup

Our pre-made stack in this repo is React, Express and MongoDb. The repo is split into 2 folders, front_end for the client side app and BackEnd for the server side.

Clone it, have a look around, run `npm i` in both folders and get building safe in the knowledge that the config is done.

Feel free to explore your Javascript imagination but don't get bogged down trying to implement a package... we wanna see your code.

### The Movie DB API

[This Mystical API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) will help you with finding all the info you could ever need about movies. It's not actually mystical.. thanks to themoviedb.org for building it! The config for the API is [here](./front-end/src/config.json)

So let's talk persistence... For this challenge, the client has asked that the database table follow a particular schema so that it can be integrated into a further set out 'Top 5' style lists.

The schema that you will need to follow for persisting the data is:

```
{
    "_id": 396371,
    "overview": "Naval Aviator, Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise), takes a whirlwind adventure with partner Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw. Sexy, misunderstood, full-throttle machismo. Tremendous.",
    "posterPath": "/h9hUP5ZJGsjL2wbERrGlj4dMjZq.jpg",
    "releaseDate": "2017-12-21",
    "title": "Top Gun",
    "ownScore": 5.0
    "communityScore": 9.9
}
```

### Quality

On that note, what are we looking for...

* Well crafted, well tested code
* Clean, object oriented design
* How you approach the problem?
* How do you interact with your pair?
* Can you push the boundaries of your knowledge?
* How do you deliver to a brief within a short time window?
* Are you having fun?
